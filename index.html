    <p> My name is Abigail Moshoeu, I'm 21 years old and live in Diepsloot with my mother and three siblings. I'm the only girl in my family. I was born and raised in Johannesburg, in a place called Cresta. I moved to Diepsloot in 2007 when my mother's employers left for Australia. I passed my matric in 2015 with a bachelors degree, I went to Kwena Molapo high school. I have an endless list of goals, but will try my level best to persue them all. My dream is to become a social worker but realised i have got the hearts for computers, then during school an IT degree was introduced and here I am today making sure I work my way. I want to be a well known female IT Specialist. </p>
